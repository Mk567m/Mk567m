## Hi there Iâ€™m currently working on a Quiz game with def functions and conditional statements with 2d lists, lists or dictionaries. Iâ€™m currently learning Python language. I have almost covered its half of course. I am learning inheritance in Python now. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on basic python like loops, conditional statements, lists and basic functions as well as html and basic Css. Iâ€™m looking for help wit beginners in python programming language, Html and Css. You can reach me by this gamil: mk84787255@gmail.com is my personal gmail. Ask me about basics of python like loops, conditional statements, lists, 2d lists, classes, dictionaries and def functions. Offensive_like_proverb: Success is like pragnancy. Everyone says congrutulations but no one knows how many times you got fu***d.
